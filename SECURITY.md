![Reporting Vulnerabilities](https://frost-leo.github.io/Leviftas/assets/images/github/security/reporting-vulnerabilities.svg)

If you discover a security vulnerability in Leviftas, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.


> [!WARNING]
> **Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
> 
> Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities can put all users at risk. Always use private channels for security reports.


Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing **frostleo.dev@gmail.com** with the following information:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

![Response Timeline](https://frost-leo.github.io/Leviftas/assets/images/github/security/response-timeline.svg)

We strive to respond quickly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with our assessment and expected timeline
- **Resolution**: Security fixes will be prioritized and released as soon as possible
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure

**Critical vulnerabilities** (those that could lead to immediate harm or data exposure) will be treated with the highest priority and may receive faster response times.
